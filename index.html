                    <li id="first">Small pets are cuter than big pets.</li>
                    <li id="second">Small pets are much more portable. You can take them to the mall and smuggle them across international borders with relative ease.</li>
                    <li id="third">You don't have to tell your landlord about small pets. (Sorry, landlords.)</li>
                    <li id="fourth">Compared to horses, small pets barely eat anything. Your pet's grocery bill will be much lower than a horse's.</li>
                    <li id="fifth">In most contests of skill or agility, small pets win.</li>
